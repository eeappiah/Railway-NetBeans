# Railway-NetBeans
1/2 third year project

Project was to use APIs, to allow liked music videos from YouTube and transfer a playlist of those videos to be search in the Spotify library and set up as a new playlist to listen to. Allowed me to understand automation and learn about APIs. Use of python was done.
